"Do they burn people where you come from?" The saunts of the math are not
used to interrogating foreign slines. Inside, not much is seen or heard from
outside the walls.

Once an interval, a prefect is chosen and allowed to leave and reconcile the
beliefs of the math with those on the outside. But this interval is only
half-over.

"No, of course not," the sline insists.

"So do your criminals roam free?"

"No, not that either. We aim to be more civilized. Outside of this mess, we
have jails and rehabilitation for the criminals." The slines are beginning to
adhear to Pothogan morals having never met or prayed to him.

An interesting outcome, and an interested sline, "Do you burn your criminals
here?"

"No."

An unsettlingly close hissing can be heard just outside the thick walls and
thin, scavenged-wood doors of the math. A glimpse of scales. Screech.

There are times to worry and times to accept. The sline has chosen only to
accept.
